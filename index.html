       <h2>About:</h2> 
        <p>
I am a senior studying journalism at the University of Miami. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Most of my time there is spent managing the news sector of WVUM 90.5 as the News Director, working as an executive producer of UMTV's "We The Students," and also working as a contributing photographer for The Miami Hurricane.
        </p>
        <p>
I spent my first two years of undergrad at Hofstra University as a staff writer and columnist for The Hofstra Chronicle.
        </p>
        <p>
I began studying journalism in hopes of spreading my humanitarian focus and genuine concern for social awareness.
